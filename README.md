# ðŸ’« swift-sfdc README

Do you ever feel like working with the salesforce.com platform wastes a lot of time?
Are you tired of switching continuously between the IDE and the platform to create (and retrieve!) the metadata you need?

The <b>swift-sfdc</b> vscode extension aims to make working with the salesforce.com platform <b>lightning fast</b>!
<b>Stop waiting for metadata retrieval and start creating the metadata directly in your local project</b>, without waiting ages to synchronize it from the cloud!

Integrate with other extensions, like ForceCode or MavensMate, to deploy the updated xml files directly to salesforce and create the best developer experience!

## Features

### Field Creation
Allows default and basic field configuration to save time while developing apex classes

#### Field Creation: XML Definition Manipulation

Interact with the XML definition of your SObjects and start creating fields directly in your local metadata. Stop with the annoying and boring retrieval process and start pushing metadata straightforward to the platform, saving one round-trip!

#### Field Creation: Default Profiles!

You have finally managed to save time by creating those custom fields straightforward into the SFDC metadata files. Now you can configure field-level security directly on the profiles metadata, saving even <b>more</b> time! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
